116.   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
118.  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
120.other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
122.Each licensee is addressed as "you".
124.  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
126.(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
128.  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
130.Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
132.portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
134.included without limitation in the term "modification".)
136.  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
138.all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
140.and installation of the library.
142.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not

146.on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
148.and what the program that uses the Library does.

152.you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an

156.Library.
158.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,

162.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
164.distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1

220.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
222.subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

240.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
242.linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
